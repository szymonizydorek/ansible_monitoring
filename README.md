# Ansible Project Based Learning Training

This repository contains my hands-on projects and training materials for learning Ansible through practical, real-world use cases. Each folder represents a project that builds on core automation concepts and tools.  

## Projects Scenario:

- **1_Docker/**  
  Setting up Docker using Ansible, including installation and configuration for container-based workflows.  

- **2_Security/**  
  Exploring Ansible’s security features: SSH key exchange, user management, Ansible Vault, firewall (UFW) configuration, and package updates.  

- **3_K8s_Install/**  
  Installing Kubernetes clusters with Ansible, automating the setup of control planes and worker nodes.  

- **4_Kubernetes_Mgmt/**  
  Managing Kubernetes resources and workloads using Ansible playbooks and roles.  

- **5_Helm/**  
  Automating Helm installation and deployment of charts via Ansible for streamlined Kubernetes application management.  

## ⚙️ Configuration Files

- **ansible.cfg** – Repository-wide Ansible configuration.  
- **inventory** – Host inventory for managing different environments and servers.  

## 🎯 Goal

The goal of this repository is to learn Ansible through project-based practice, focusing on automation, security, and orchestration in modern DevOps environments.  

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Expand with more Ansible roles and playbooks.  
- Integrate monitoring and logging use cases.  
- Add CI/CD automation with Jenkins + Ansible.
